/**
 * Walks through all objects in the asset backing store (S3 bucket) and checks that the objects
 * also exist in the resource backing store (DynamoDB). If the file exists in S3 but does not
 * exist in Dynamo, then the object is considered a dead dangling pointer, and has no chance of
 * ever being accessed. Therefore, this reaper hard-deletes those dangling objects in S3. This
 * helps ensure that the object tree as managed by the {@link ResourceManager} stays in sync
 * with the objects accessible by the {@link AssetManager}.
